NEXT.JS

1. Next.js simplifies the development process
2. Optimizes the web app through priary features.

Rendering:
1. React does client side rendering while Next.js does server side rendering. Next.js also has options in which we can control on either client side or server side rendering.
2. Client-side rendering happens on client's browser. When a user request a webpage to the server. the server sends the html,css and JS of the page to the user. The user browsr downloads and executes the downloaded document and rendering the components, displaying the webpage.
3. Server side rendering renders the web page directly in the server before transfering it to the client. 
4. This aspect SEO enables easy crawling, indexing in server side rendering. SEO is crucial for optimizing a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results.
5. this helps in increased organic traffic, enhanced user experience, credibility & trustworthiness and competitive advantage. It impacts the sucess of the website and online presence.

6. Routing: I Reatc we need react router. In next.js it used a file based route system. Each folder becomes a route and the file insdie the folder becomes route path.
7.Next.JS has flexibility to create Fullstack app in Next.JS v9. this feature is done usinf API routes. It enables the creation of serverless functions to handle API requests. Serverless APIs s a way to create API endpoints without the need of a traditional server. We can create a API endoint by creating a route.js in a folder inside next.js app.
Moving from react+express+webpack to next.js resulted in removing 20000+ lines of code and 30+dependencies while improving Hot Module Reloading from 1.3s to 131 ms.
Automatic code splitting. Code splitting is a techniquethat breaks down large bundles of JS code into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be loaded as needed. This reduces the load time of the website.In reatc, it's manual.
So, Next.JS mainly let us focus on building the essential business logic of the application and automates most of the remaining process.
Next.JS is fundamentally built on top of react. It is just an extenson of react.
